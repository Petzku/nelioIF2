		You have entered room 730B, also known as the Aquarium.
      	You can see it's is filled with exotic fishes.
      	For your great disappointment they are fast asleep,
      	snoring in a very peculiar formation.
      	Four of them are lying on the bed and one is curled up in their feet.
      	Four more form a small pile on the floor.
      	Their scales shimmer slightly in the dim light coming in
      	from the door. The carpet looks soft
      	and you start feeling a little drowsy.
      	You decide it's better to leave before you too fall asleep.
      	The idea of sleeping with the fishes does
      	not seem too tempting right now.
		<!-- TODO -->
		You can go east from here.
