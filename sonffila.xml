	<description>
		You are in a tiny, empty room. There are three doors
      	leading to different rooms and one open doorway to the corridor.
      	The lighting is dim, but enough for you to see
      	"Ministry of Internal affairs" written on one of the doors.
      	The next one says "Aquarium". The las door seems to be locked.
      	You can hear the rattling of mahjong tiles in the hallway.
		<!-- TODO -->
		You can go north, south, east or west from here.
