		The room is gloomy, it has couple of shelves around it. 
		The room contains at least two white shelves and lots of random stuff.
		In the middle of room there is a figure.
		The figure seems to reflect light a little bit
		and it has something long and pointy in its hand.
		As your eyes begin to adapt to darkness,
		you recognise the face of the character, it's MeS!
		This conjures up the r√§stis, which have deadline today!
		You have done them for sure, but where are they?!?
