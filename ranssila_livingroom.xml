	<description>
		You move to the Ranssila living room. You hear an abnormal noice caused
		by dozens of emus running around aimlessly. In the room you can also
		see a fridge, a sofa, a microwave, three tables and a few almost broken
		chairs. The whole room is a mess probably caused by the emu farm.
		<!-- TODO -->
		You can go north from here.
