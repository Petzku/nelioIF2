		You are in a long, wide hallway. You can see out from the large windows on one side, on the other side there are several doors.  In the end of the hallway there is a small, open door. You can see a large bookshelf in the room behind it. In the other end is a shut door with a picture of bananas on it. On that end there are stairs, cold and gray and leading to both upper and lower floors. 
		<!-- TODO -->
		You can go northwest, north, east, west, up or down from here.
