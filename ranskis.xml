		You are now in Ranskis. A circle formed from old sofas, one of them
      	taped together with duct tape, fills the room.
      	There are some people playing a board game around large table.
      	Their heads are bowed in concentration, they are barely breathing.
      	There are random words scattered across a small blackboard,
      	followed by squares.
      	A noisy group is assebling around the sofas,
      	with a man with a magnificent beard in the center. 
		<!-- TODO -->
		You can go west or south from here.
