		This is the lab. There is an abandoned mattress on the floor, covered in dust.  There are some plants and garden utilities in the corner of the room, including fertilizers and flower pots. There is a clean sink and a table. The table is covered by a mountain of miscellanous papers. A small cupboard clings desperately to the wall above it. The door is slightly ajar and you can see the cupboard is filled with mysterious-looking bottles and instruments.  There is a lock on the cupboard door, but it is loose and you could easily take anything from the cupboard. You were never very good with chemistry, so you'd really like to leave before you do something you shouldn't.
		<!-- TODO -->
		You can go west from here.
