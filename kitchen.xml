		This is a small room where people often make food. On the left, there are shelves full of food on top of each other, containers and sauce pans. On the right there is an oven and more shelves. You look forward and see a refrigerator and a microwave. There is a doorway behind you.
		<!-- TODO -->
		You can go north from here.
