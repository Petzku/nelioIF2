		You are now in Pikkuranskis.  You see rows of desks and chairs,
      	positioned for looking at a blackboard filled with scribbling and
      	doodles.
      	Behind the blackboard are two doors, leading into smaller rooms.
      	A small group of people has reorganized some of the desks to form
      	a circle.
      	One of them approaches you, while the rest sit
      	down in their circle of chairs.
		<!-- TODO -->
		You can go northwest, southwest, south or east from here.
