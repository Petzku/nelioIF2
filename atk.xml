		This is a large classroom. On the left there are computers located next
		to the wall and a small group of people playing video games. There is an
		admin writing kludgy code intensively. On the right, there are a few
		students discussing about some mathematical problem in front of a
		whiteboard. Tandem chess is being played in the middle of class. There
		is a couple of cookies in a package on the table.

		There is a door south of you.
