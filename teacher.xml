		    You are in the Teachers' room.
			You see a table at the back of the room and
			white bookshelves surrounding the room,
			most of the space is taken by dozens of piles of papers.
			Lights are on, but one paper stack covers the lamp,
			making the room shady.
			Between paper piles on your right side you see a door.
