<room name="ranssila">
	<description>
		You have entered Ranssila. You stand in a narrow room  where you can see an open door ahead. You walk through it and enter an undecorated room with two tables covered with piles of clothes and a bed where someone has slept restlessly. The bed's bedsheets are hardly on the bed anymore. There is a sauna stove in a corner.
		<!-- TODO -->
		You can go east and south from here.
